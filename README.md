# ReinforcementLearning-Minihack-QuestHard-v0
This repository is the source code for creating an agent to complete the Minihack-Quest-Hard-v0 environment. 

We provide two different algorithm implementations:
1. A deep NN policy model trained with PPO
1. A  deep NN Q Network trained with backpropagation.
1. A  deep NN Q Network trained with Neuro-evolution.
